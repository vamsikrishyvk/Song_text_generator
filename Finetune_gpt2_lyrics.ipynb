            " a man who had lost his mind over the issue, which was the consequence of two nights' reasoning: I laid my eyes on the matter, expecting some other thing. \"For,\" said it, \"it had been long pondered, and my ignorance how to judge, did not make me fit to give a account of it: I was now so ready to view it that I called for some advice; it being a gross misfortune, and my ignorance of the matter making me take no notice, left me no chance of getting my observations in order: \"\n",

The loss that I have forgotten may be given me as an illustration: I took a cursory look at the bills, and called my own money, when I had only lye for what I had receiv'd. I had also a share of the money, and of the silver as silver: And it will be seen, what value it had. Now whatever gold is, whatever silver is, whatever gold is, whatever it be, no one regards without opinion, and whatever it yieldeth, it will be of value.\"\n",

            "Our talk was over, till Trimalchio return'd from Africa, and fill'd the silence with his remarks. \"This poor fellow,\" said he, \"invincible, but without wits, is he: He has put in a thousand servants, or rather, has lost a great deal of his estate: He has got a very poor livery, dyed ruelly, gold, silver, gold; but it is well-deserved: He has sunk ships, with his company, and another that has been sunk; but he has no one to commend his good qualities. He wears his portick as a code, but when he comes he does so with a shout, and with the same eloquence, that all the rest will laugh at.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "This making my heart turn to the matter, I asked him what estate I had. He said, \"You'll have other servants than my own, which I understand you will not do; but if you would give me another servant of your own, I should have him even as a servant of mine; for my master has a servant called Habinas of his own making and will recommend it to you; but it is by no means the same master as your master-in-law. You cannot forbear making a noise respecting a matter, when it can be done.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "With that saying, he brought me another of his kind, of an upper rank, a servant of mine, master-san'd me with it: And so satisfied that I gave no reply, that I gave him nothing but what I had with me, I have not, however, so much as I gave him credit; nor was there any thing in the world but the will of Habinas. When I shamm'd him with more fowl and game, he seem'd at last to have been dead, or at least in his own room for that matter; and I had better thank him, for it kept him in his statue, which I recommend to every house; but if you must, you'll have him again by degrees. Besides, Habinas himself seem'd by that time become wealthy, and gave us a ratling of presents, and of this ratling of my own made me wealthy, without either taking my tastables well or taking them for granted: In short, what had taken us so long, has now bought us a great many: Habinas is a freedman, I take him by the name of Habinas; he seems to have been his master, as Habinas himself has said, or else as he was brought up; whatever it be, he gave me the thing I chose for myself, of which I am ignorant. I do not think my self sufficient for a while, for I am wholly ignorant of every part of it, which I shall try in my later years, because it is what it is: For my self, what man could do but to imitate Habinas? And as I have said, I have not yet seen the thing that brought me the honour, for at first I sought afterwards, as having gotten by the less good; when in the course of time, I came to acquire the title of 'Haus of Habinas.' You may think me rich by this, but poor! It is the same man: He has all this in abundance, but\n",
